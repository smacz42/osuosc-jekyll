# [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

## Forked for OSUOSC

This means that all that is needed to add a talk or a news item in a weekly rundown is to issue a PR with the new item under the `_posts` or `_tutorials` directory respectively.

Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add content, and more read the [theme's documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

## Quick Start

1. Run Bundler to install the theme gem and dependencies:

```bash
bundle install --path ${HOME}/.gem
```

To test the theme, run `$ bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/`. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the repo directory. As modifications are made to the theme, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.

When you are done, or if you have to restart the server, it is recommended to issue an `$ bundle exec rake clean`, which resets the multipage hackery that is run in `_posts/` to generate `/news/`. Go ahead, check out the markdown pages while the server is running.

#### TODO: make a function `$ bundle exec rake new_post`
* Specific format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`
* YAML front matter
    * `layout: multipage`
    * `collection: news`
    * `date: YYYY-MM-DD`

## Contributing

Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site's unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask. 

This goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-post`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install --path ${HOME}/.gem`.

To update the theme run `bundle update`. **Be careful - this may break OSUOSC customizations.**
