This Thursday, October 1, at 7PM in Caldwell 120, Matt Meinwald will speak on logical volume management, specifically covering LVM, ZFS, and Btrfs. He will discuss a bit of the background and history of these systems, and describe the key features each provides. Hopefully by the end of this talk you will consider throwing away your legacy partitions (after taking backups!) and embracing these technologies.

This weekend (October 2nd & 3rd) is the thirteenth annual Ohio LinuxFest held in the greater Columbus Convention Center.  Registering in advance is free however the price jumps to $10 the day of the event. On Saturday morning (October 3rd) at 8:00am we are meeting at Tim Hortons (200 West Nationwide Blvd, Stadium). We will then walk over to the Convention Center together in time for the 9:00am keynote.
