Join us this Thursday, March 23rd in Dreese 264 at 19:00 for a talk by Daniel Thau, creator of Bedrock Linux.

Daniel "paradigm" Thau will introduce the Rust programming language. Rust is a programming language with a focus on both performance and correctness with an emphasis on compile-time assurances against memory and data race issues. The presentation will give an overview of the more notable aspects of Rust with the intent to equip the audience to readily learn more, if interested.
