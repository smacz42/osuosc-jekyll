---

This Thursday, October 29th at 7PM in Caldwell 120, I, Eli Gladman, will speak on wireless security and penetration testing. Specifically I will be going over common network vulnerabilities and misconceptions. After a brief introduction, I will demonstrate how to brute force particular types of WiFi access points due to their inherently insecure "encryption". I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security.

The intention of this talk is to educate members with respect to securing their own local networks. We are by no means responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. Performing said activities without the explicit permission of said owner is against the law.
