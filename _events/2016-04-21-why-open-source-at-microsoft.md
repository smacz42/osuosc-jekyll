What started as a war is turning to a love affair. Over the last two decades, Microsoft has moved from a fierce opponent of the penguin to recently being welcomed by Ubuntu, Red Hat and others. Come for an interactive discussion of Microsoftâ€™s journey with Open Source and see some demos of the new Bash on Windows and .Net Core.

Brian Sherwin is a Sr. Technical Evangelist with Microsoft from Columbus, Ohio. He has been a consultant and trainer for over 17 years. One of his core passions is helping companies make decisions based on value and not a particular technology. When he's not trying to figure out some new technology, he spends time reading, Scouting, and drinking enough coffee to keep up with his five kids.
