Thursday, 2015-04-02 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Eli Gladman will be speaking about BeagleBone. A short description follows:

My talk will include a brief overview of embedded Linux, particularly what sets it apart from traditional architectures. The majority of my talk will however focus on the BeagleBone Bone and its capabilities running embedded Linux. During my talk I will be demonstrating a series of example projects coded live.

In addition, we will take time at the beginning of the meeting to go over officer positions and their responsibilities, in anticipation for next week's elections.
Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
