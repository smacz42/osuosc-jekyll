Join us Thursday January 26th at 19:00 in Caldwell 120 as [Professor DK Panda](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~panda), a distinguished scholar of the CSE department and member of the Network-Based Computing Laboratory at OSU.

The Network-Based Computing Laboratory at OSU/CSE in actively engaged in designing software libraries for supercomputers. The open-source [MVAPICH software project](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu) at OSU/CSE has been enabling MPI libraries for TOP supercomputers in the World (including the latest #1st ranked) during the last decade. The group is also involved in designing [High-Performance Big Data](http://hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu) libraries for Hadoop, Spark and Memcached, and are focused on [High-Performance Deep Learning](http://hidl.cse.ohio-state.edu) such as Caffe and CNTK. This talk will provide an overview of these projects. It will also provide an outline of the associated research, publications, designs, testing and support framework for these libraries. Opportunities for students to get involved in the R&D activities in these projects will be outlined. The talk will follow with an open Q&A session with several members of the Network-Based Computing Laboratory. The session will conclude with a tour of the Laboratory consisting of multiple high-end clusters involving thousands of cores.
