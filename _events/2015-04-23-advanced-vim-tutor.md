This Thursday, 2015/04/23 at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs 120, Daniel Thau
will present a tour of Vim functionality.  Prior Vim experience is not
required.  This presentation will aim to cover things at a high-level in
order to cover a broad number of Vim subsystems.  This is done in the
hopes of getting to new topics not covered in previous OSC Vim
presentations.  However, but if requested the presenter can go into
further detail on any of the discussed items - do not hesitate to speak
up and ask for further detail.  A list of `:help`-able items will be
provided after the presentation to reference to minimize the need for
note-taking.

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
