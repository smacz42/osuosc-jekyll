Daniel "paradigm" Thau will present Bedrock Linux, a Linux distribution which
allows the use of software from a variety of typically mutually exclusive Linux
distributions, simultaneously and transparently.

If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL
clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch
Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage, and ensure that
software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the
same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux will provide a means to
achieve this.

The presentation will cover the motivation behind the Bedrock Linux, various
real-world use cases for the project, concepts useful for utilizing and
understanding it, as well as future plans.
