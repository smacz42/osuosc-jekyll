Join us Thursday February 9th, 2017 at 19:00 as Brian Costlow, a PyOhio board member and previous conference chair, presents on Python. A summary from Brian Costlow:

All languages, even programming languages, develop idioms.
Python is such a flexible language that newcomers to the language sometimes end up writing "C in Python" or "Java in Python".
This talk will cover some common pitfalls where there is more than one way to do it, and show you which one a seasoned Pythonista would reach for.
Along the way, we'll talk about iterators, generators, data structures, comprehensions and more.
