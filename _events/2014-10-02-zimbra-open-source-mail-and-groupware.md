This Thursday, 2014-10-02 in Caldwell Labs 120, William Osler will present Zimbra: Open Source Mail & Groupware. Description follows.

Email has been the core of how we communicate via the internet for longer than some of us have been alive, but in modern times can involve a complex interaction between various systems to get your message from point A to point B. But it doesn’t have to be hard. I’ll be going over Zimbra, an open source mail and groupware solution that you can host and run yourself. With the right server and a domain name, you can take control of your email, calendar, contacts and files and have the convenience of “the cloud” without the PRISM.

I will be doing a live demo of setup during this meeting, and you can follow along if you have previous GNU/Linux experience. You’ll need a VPS with at least 2 GB of memory running Ubuntu 12.04 and a domain name set up and pointing to the box. You can download the necessary files ahead of time at http://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration-open-source

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
